# PlebyNova's Minecraft Portfolio

#### Description:
Hello world! I am PlebyNova, and this project has been on my bucket list for a while now. Ever since I started writing things down to put on my resumé, I knew I had to do something Minecraft related. I’ve been playing Minecraft for five years, and in that time I’ve made some builds/bases that I’ve wanted to show off. So my final project is a portfolio of all my best works.
Upon going to ‘pleby-nova.github.io’ (I’m using Github Pages to run my website), you will see a welcome page. There, a 1 minute video will automatically play and introduce you to myself and my website. When you scroll down and click ‘LET’S GO!’, you will be redirected to the main page. If you click the logo at the top, it will take you back to the welcome page. On the portfolio page, there are four images, each of the builds I am showing.

Each build page has a title, a button to return to the main portfolio page, a description, a picture of a specific area, a video walkthrough, an option to download the .litematic file (you need the litematica mod for this), and some credits (if any are necessary)

The first is a 3 player floating island base. The island is held up by a massive piston, and there is room for 3 players to live there, each with a storage room. The first base is a botanical house, the second is a treehouse, and the third base is a steampunk airship.

The second build is a barn house that was designed to function in real life. It has a garage with a car, workshop, and a study. The main house has a bunk room and den downstairs. On the main floor is a living room, porch, kitchen, dining room, and the master suite. The second floor has two bedrooms and a bathroom, as well as a balcony.

The third build is an accurate Roman villa. It features two shops out the front, an atrium, and off to the side, two cubiculi, or bedrooms. Past the atrium, there is a courtyard with a tablino, or office to the right. To the left,there is the triclinium, or dining room. Next to the triclinium is the culina, or kitchen. Out the back of the kitchen is the hortus, or garden. This is where the food is grown. In the very back of the house,there is a latrina, or bathroom.

The final build is a trading hall for villagers. It was intended to be built in the side of a hill. There is a secret entrance, and inside, there is space for 18 villagers. On the balcony, there is storage, and a secret exit. The exit would lead to an above ground structure (if it were built in a survival world). That structure is up to you to build!

The whole idea of my website is not only to show off my builds, but to inspire others to build their own creations! I love seeing how people use Minecraft to express their own unique style. I hope you are inspired to create something now, because this was the Final Project!
