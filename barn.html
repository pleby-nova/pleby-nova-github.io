                <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
                <p>
                    This house was designed to function in real life. It starts with an accurate garage, with a car inside.
                    There is also a workshop with some tools, and a study upstairs. Outside the garage, there is a basketball court.
                    Up the path, there is the main house. It has a spacious living room, and a kitchen. The dining room seats 6,
                    and off of the living room, there is the master suite. The master suite has a private porch, and a bathroom.
                    Downstairs there is a gaming room, and 2 identical bunk rooms. Upstairs, there is a balcony, and 2 bedrooms.
                    There is also a silo that, in real life, I designed to be an AirBnB for guests. It has 4 floors: a living room,
                    kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. There is also an outdoor pavilion with a functional grill and hot tub.
